## Trajectories of Engagement (2025)

A research showcase exploring how researchers and external actors meet, collaborate and co‚Äëcreate knowledge across physical and digital settings to address public issues. The site presents a curated set of projects from the humanities and social sciences, highlighting their participatory ‚Äútrajectories of engagement,‚Äù the socio‚Äëtechnical choices involved, and reflections from practitioners.

> A living observatory of participatory research practices across HSS projects.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Trajectories of engagement refer to moments in the research process where external actors are involved and co‚Äëconstruct knowledge with the research team. These research paths involving an outside can take various forms of material production based on physical and/or digital environments. Often used in digital data‚Äëgrounded labs or citizen science projects, trajectories of engagement are shaped in research which aims to address social concerns or public issues.

This research project aims to explore and describe the different forms that trajectories of engagement can take in the humanities and social sciences, the interactions between internal and external actors that they can generate, and the materiality of the socio‚Äëtechnical choices involved. The expected outputs are to build an observatory and a network of researchers interested in studying these trajectories and a book will be written to present the identified trajectories.

## What‚Äôs in the website

- **Home**: An interactive 3D carousel of project posters. Hovering highlights a project and shows contextual info; clicking opens its detail page.
- **Archive**: A sortable table of all projects with dates, title, authors, institutions and a link to the presentation video.
- **Project pages**: For each project you‚Äôll find:
  - **Metadata**: title, dates, project leaders, research center.
  - **Texts (when available)**: presentation, experience, concept.
  - **Video player with excerpts**: embedded YouTube with a ‚ÄúNext segment‚Äù control that jumps through curated timecodes.
  - **Poster viewer**: compare original and annotated posters using a blend slider.
- **About + contact**: Project background and a contact link.

## Data model and assets

- **Datasource**: `src/lib/datasource.json` contains the site metadata and the list of projects with fields such as `metadata` (id, title, year, project_leaders, research_center), `presentationURL`, `texts` (optional presentation/experience/concept), and `excerpts` (typed segments with timecodes for the video player).
- **Posters**: Stored in `src/lib/assets/posters/` as `{id}.png` and `{id}_annotated.png`. These power both the home carousel and the poster comparison on project pages.

### Data model fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata.id` | string | Route slug and poster filename stem |
| `metadata.title` | string | Project title |
| `metadata.year` | string | Year or range (e.g., `2020 - 2023`) |
| `metadata.project_leaders` | string | Author(s) / coordinator(s) |
| `metadata.research_center` | string | Institution(s) |
| `presentationURL` | string | Video URL (YouTube supported) |
| `texts.presentation` | string | Project presentation (optional) |
| `texts.experience` | string | Field notes / lived experience (optional) |
| `texts.concept` | string | Conceptual framing (optional) |
| `excerpts[].type` | string | Segment label (e.g., `discussion`, `debriefing`) |
| `excerpts[].timecodes[]` | string[] | Start‚Äìend pairs as `m:s` or `h:m:s` strings |
